## Overview
This project analyses New York City Bike dta to determine is a bike-shring business would work in Des Moines. On this project I used Tableau to crete visualiztions to better illustrate what the data shows to the investors.

- In August 2019, there were over 2.3 million rides
- 81% of the users were subscribers while 19% were non-subscribers
- 65% of the users were confirmed males, 25% were confirmed females and 10% did not have their genders confirmed
- There was a wide range of ages for the users and the top starting locations were near big tourist locations
### August Peak Hours

- The highest active hours were between 5 and 7 PM
- The least active hours were between 2 and 5 AM which is the best time to perform bike maintenance
### Checkout times for users

- Out of all users, bikes were most often checked out for 4 to 6 hours
### Checkout times by gender

- Checkout times by gender do not show much difference between amount of hours used, but male users take approximately 3 times more rides than female users
### Trips by weekday, gender, and weekday and gender

- Most weekday rides occur between 7 and 9 AM and 5 and 7 PM, which indicates most people use their bikes to commute to and from work. This differs from weekend rides which most often occur between 10 AM and 7 PM which means people are using them throughout the day and are going to take longer rides or use them for longer periods.
## Summary
The data shows high usage of the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August 2019. The majority of the rides occured on Manhattan Island which makes sense since it is easier to use and store a  bike on the island. This is due to the large amount of people, lack of parking spots, and high rents or parking rates for parking spots. As stated earlier, the majority of bike rides that occur during the weekdays are during morning and evening rush hours so users bike s a means to get to and from work, while the weekend riders are most likely using bikes for longer periods to run errands and hit tourist spots around the city. Additional analysis would be beneficial, such as:
- Comparing usge for different months to determine trends, like how weather affects usage
- Another point of analysis would be trying to get additional data on weekend rides, such as why the users are biking or how many stops they mke during their trips as this could let the investors know if its tourists, errands, or rides for exercise
